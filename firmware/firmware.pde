/*
Normally, an ATtiny is used to control things. If an Arduino is used instead, then we can
also control things via serial. This requires slightly different wiring as pins 0 and 1,
which are used to control the light and sound from an ATtiny are the serial lines on an
Arduino and we want to have serial communications running. So the light should be moved
from pin 0 to pin 5 and sound should be moved from pin 1 to pin 6. Then change the
following #define to true and serial control will be enabled. Connect the Arduino to a
computer via USB, figure out the serial port to be used (the same one you use to program
the Arduino), then open that serial port at 9600,8,n,1 and send the one letter commands
defined below. The single letters are all you send (no line-endings or anything else) and
they are mnemonics: Dark, Light, Coin, One-up, and Pause. For example, to turn the light
on for the duration of the coin sound and then right back off, send LCD. To do that three
times with a 1/4 second pause between each, send LCDPPPPPLCDPPPPPLCD.
